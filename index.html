    <p class="ty">"Hi Everyone, I’m XX from “ place”. I’m attending this school or class because it has always been
        something I’ve been fascinated with or was looking forward to since childhood. I love meeting new people
        and going on trips to art galleries and I am more excited to learn more and gain more knowledge from
        this class. Thank you”.

        “Hey, I’m Tommy, people here call me Tom. I grew up in India and lived there most of my life before
        moving to Dubai. I speak Hindi, Marathi, French, and English. I love gaming, and cricket as a sport. I
        wanted to learn Arabic so enrolled on this class or program.</p>

    <p class="ol">Generally, an achievement is any previous success you're proud of. This means anything from raising a
        family
        to earning a degree or overcoming a chronic illness. But when it comes to your CV, only highlight
        achievements that: Demonstrate your capacity to do the job at hand.</p>

    <p class="pl">Our inner voice, gut feeling or intuition whatever we may like to call it, provide the best insights
        when
        we are least looking for it. So today when I was enjoying the rare luxury of quietness around the house
        with no TV, music, laptop or a book in my lap....and just looking out of the window into
        nothingness....there it was! It was such an 'Aha' moment. It felt like the gray clouds had disappeared
        suddenly into nothingness, the sun had decided to peep out shining bright on the stage of my life ahead.
        It was as if I was sitting by the window watching the play unfold, one act at a time. It was a sudden
        realization, a meaningful thought which I felt like penning down. And so here it is!</p>
